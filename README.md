# Animal Identifier

A SwiftUI app that uses Machine Learning to identify the scientific name and breed of animals based on trained image data.

## Features
- Utilizes Core ML to process and classify animal images.
- Identifies both the scientific name and breed of various animals.
- Trained with a custom dataset of animal photos.
- User-friendly interface powered by SwiftUI.

## Requirements
- iOS 14+  
- Xcode 12+  
- macOS 11.0+  

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/animal-identifier.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or a connected iOS device.

## How It Works
1. Users upload or capture a photo of an animal.
2. The app processes the image using a pre-trained ML model.
3. Results display the scientific name and breed of the animal.

## ML Model
- The app uses a Core ML model trained with a diverse dataset of animal photos.
- Model trained using [TensorFlow/PyTorch/Core ML Tools].
- Dataset sourced from [Dataset Source].

## Screenshots
Include images of the app's interface here. Example:
![Home Screen](screenshots/home.png)  
![Prediction Screen](screenshots/prediction.png)

## Usage
- Open the app.
- Tap the "+" button to select or capture an image.
- View the scientific name and breed information.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset to include more species and breeds.
- Add support for real-time camera predictions.
- Improve accuracy of the ML model.
